# housingproject

Some general notes:
  rawData.xlsx is the initial dataset that was given.
  finalData.xlsx is what the dataset was condensed into throughout the project.
  finalProject.docx is a formal write-up of everything I did with data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, visualizations, and regression tests.
