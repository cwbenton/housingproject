# Housing Market Data Analysis

This project was a final exam for an introductory data science course at Kennesaw State University, which
utilized all topics learned throughout the semester. The entire analysis was done in Microsoft Excel using
the Data Analysis TookPak. Though this is one of my first data science projects, I would argue it to be a
valuable resource to see where I started.

## General Notes

- `datasets` consists of the datasets used.
   - `raw.xlsx` is the initial dataset that was given.
   - `final.xlsx` is what the dataset was condensed into throughout the project. This excel spreadsheet is most likely
   an unorganized, jumbled mess.
- `documents` consists of all formal write-up pertaining to the project.
   - `finalProject.docx` is a raw, formal write-up of everything I did with data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis,
   visualizations, and regression tests.
   - `finalProject.pdf` is the finalized write-up. There are no adjustments from the `.docx` file.
